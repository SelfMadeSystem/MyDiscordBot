# MyDiscordBot

A simple Discord bot written in TypeScript.


## Getting Started

`npm install` installs the dependencies.

`npm start` starts the bot.

Before starting the bot, make a `localconfig.json` file in the src directory with the following contents:

```json
{
    "token": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
    "guildId": "YOUR_GUILD_ID_HERE",
    "clientId": "BOT_ID_HERE"
}
```
Run `npm run depcmd` to deploy the bot's commands to the server.
